I'm a Ph.D. student in Theoretical Biophysics, under the supervision of [Andrea Parmeggiani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-parmeggiani-9600616/?originalSubdomain=fr) & [Nils-Ole Walliser](https://sites.google.com/view/nils-ole-walliser) at [Laboratoire Charles Coulomb](https://coulomb.umontpellier.fr) (L2C - UMR 5221).

I'm also a teaching assistant for the Department of Mathematics at [Montpellier Faculty of Sciences](https://sciences.edu.umontpellier.fr) & [Polytech Montpellier Engineering School](https://www.polytech.umontpellier.fr).


Research interests
======
My Ph.D. work aims at:

- Modeling bacterial respiration: developing a physical model of bacterial respiration using statistical physics and stochastic process theory to understand the spatial organization and dynamics of OXPHOS complexes on bacterial membranes, focusing on phase separation phenomena in nanodomains.

- Influence of spatial organization on reactivity: investigating how the spatiotemporal organization of OXPHOS complexes and quinone dynamics affect the reactivity of these complexes and contribute to the formation of transmembrane electrochemical gradients. This includes studying organized domain distributions versus dispersed networks of charge sources and sinks.

- Functional importance in charge transfer: revealing the functional significance of spatiotemporal organization in transmembrane charge transfer biophysics at both the single bacterium and population levels. This research aims to understand OXPHOS function in nitrate respiration by integrating physicochemical modeling of electron transfer with high-resolution fluorescence microscopy data and bacterial metabolism insights.

Highlights
======
- I supervised bachelor's degree students for their "introduction to research" internship.
