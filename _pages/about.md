I'm a PhD student in Theoretical Biophysics with a strong background in Mathematics, especially in theoretical and numerical analysis of PDEs. I work under the supervision of [Andrea Parmeggiani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-parmeggiani-9600616/?originalSubdomain=fr) and [Nils-Ole Walliser](https://sites.google.com/view/nils-ole-walliser) at [Charles Coulomb Laboratory](https://coulomb.umontpellier.fr) (Montpellier, France). I'm a part of the Complex Systems and Non-linear Phenomena team of the Theoretical Physics axis.

I'm also a teaching assistant for the Physics Department at [Montpellier Faculty of Sciences](https://sciences.edu.umontpellier.fr).

Research interests
======

My PhD work aims at:

- <b>Modeling bacterial respiration:</b> developing a physical model of bacterial respiration using statistical physics and stochastic process theory to understand the spatial organization and dynamics of OXPHOS complexes on bacterial membranes

- <b>Understanding the influence of the spatial organization:</b> investigating how the spatiotemporal organization of OXPHOS complexes and quinones dynamics affect the reactivity of these complexes and contribute to the formation of transmembrane electrochemical gradients

- <b>Using experimental data:</b> collaborating with a team of biologists specialized in biochemistry, cellular biology and experimental biophysics to obtain data about bacterial metabolism and the movement of the respiration complexes using high resolution fluorescence microscopy.

<i>Keywords:</i> biological physics, bacteria, non-linear physics, PDEs, stochastic processes, numerical simulation, physico-mathematical modelling, Monte-Carlo methods, transmembrane electrochemical gradient
