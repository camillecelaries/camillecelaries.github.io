I'm a Ph.D. student in Theoretical Biophysics, under the supervision of [Andrea Parmeggiani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-parmeggiani-9600616/?originalSubdomain=fr) & [Nils-Ole Walliser](https://sites.google.com/view/nils-ole-walliser) at [Laboratoire Charles Coulomb](https://coulomb.umontpellier.fr) (Montpellier, France). I am a part of the Complex Systems and Non-linear Phenomena team of the Theoretical Physics axis.

I'm also a teaching assistant for the Physics Department at [Montpellier Faculty of Sciences](https://sciences.edu.umontpellier.fr).


Research interests
======

My Ph.D. work aims at:

- <b>Modeling bacterial respiration:</b> developing a physical model of bacterial respiration using statistical physics and stochastic process theory to understand the spatial organization and dynamics of OXPHOS complexes on bacterial membranes

- <b>Understand the influence of the spatial organization</b>: investigating how the spatiotemporal organization of OXPHOS complexes and quinone dynamics affect the reactivity of these complexes and contribute to the formation of transmembrane electrochemical gradients

- <b>Functional importance in charge transfer</b>: revealing the functional significance of spatiotemporal organization in transmembrane charge transfer biophysics at both the single bacterium and population levels. This research aims to understand OXPHOS function in nitrate respiration by integrating physicochemical modeling of electron transfer with high-resolution fluorescence microscopy data and bacterial metabolism insights.
