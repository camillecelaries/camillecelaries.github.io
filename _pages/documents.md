***
<b> Modeling the morphodynamics of the coastline by non-linear diffusion </b>.

<i>Abstract</i>. Development of a numerical simulation tool for the dynamics of the coastline in plan (sky view) from a set of formalisms based on a principle of diffusion. Solving the problem with different numerical schemes applied to a set of PDEs belonging to the family of linear and non-linear diffusion equations. 

Advised by Frédéric Bouchette.

***

<b> φ-FEM method for solving linear elasticity problem</b>.

<i>Abstract</i>. Development of a new non-conform finite-element method called φ-FEM on unstructured meshes. Applying it to solid mechanics problems, especially from linear elasticity.

Advised by Vanessa Lleras.
