<i>Title</i>. Physical modeling of bacterial respiration and charge transfer.

<i>Field</i>. Theoretical Physics, Biophysics.

<i>Abstract</i>. Energy conversion in most bacterial systems involves the use of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient. This gradient is maintained under non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions by the activity of membrane proteins that transport protons, connected by lipidic electron shuttles called quinones, which are key elements in charge transport associated with the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) process. This process thus fuels the charge gradient that drives the activity of transmembrane rotary motors like the F1-Fo-ATP synthase or the bacterial flagellar motor, fundamental machines for bacterial life.

This theoretical physics project inspired by biological systems aims to:

1) Construct a physical model of bacterial respiration using statistical physics and stochastic process theory to understand the physical principles of spatial organization (notably the origin of phase separation phenomena in nanodomains and their network) and the dynamics of these complexes, the OXPHOS, on the bacterial membrane.
2) Understand how the spatiotemporal organization of OXPHOS complexes and the dynamics of quinones influence the reactivity of these complexes (study of quinone reactivity based on the organization of OXPHOS) and enable the establishment of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient (e.g., organized domain distribution vs. dispersed networks of charge sources and sinks).
3) Reveal the functional importance of such spatiotemporal organization in the biophysics of transmembrane charge transfer at the scale of a single bacterium and a population of bacteria. This is particularly to understand the functioning of OXPHOS in nitrate respiration. For this objective, we will combine physico-mathematical modeling of electron transfer at the bacterial membrane, between OXPHOS complexes via quinones, with data obtained from high-resolution spatial and temporal fluorescence microscopy approaches and bacterial metabolism data (collaboration with A. Magalon and D. Marguet, Marseille).

Theoretical methods employed will heavily rely on statistical physics, stochastic process theory, and numerical simulations/calculations.
